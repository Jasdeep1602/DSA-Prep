🏷️ Each element has a priority, and
🚦 Elements with higher priority are dequeued before lower ones — regardless of insertion order.

📦 Difference from a Regular Queue:
-Regular Queue                   	Priority Queue
-First-In-First-Out (FIFO)	      Highest-priority-out (not FIFO)
-Order matters	                  Priority matters

🔧 How It Works Internally
A heap (usually a min heap or max heap) is the most efficient data structure to implement a priority queue.

Operation	Time Complexity
insert()	O(log n)
pop()	    O(log n)
peek()	  O(1)
