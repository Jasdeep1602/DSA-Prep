Basic Data Structures Questions: 

✅Arrays:
  -Insertion (Start, End, Kth)
  -Deletion (Start, End, Kth)
  -Merging
  
    
✅2D Arrays(Matrix):
  -Identity Matrix: An identity matrix is a special diagonal matrix where all diagonal elements are 1, and all non-diagonal elements are 0.
  -Symmetric Matrix: A symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its transpose.The entries of a symmetric matrix are symmetric with respect
       to the main diagonal. Note: The transpose of a matrix is found by interchanging its rows into columns or columns into rows.
  -Sparse Matrix: A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. Sparse matrices are often used in situations where storage space
       needs to be optimized.
  
  -Traveral, Multiply, Rotation
  -Finding path with minimum sum
  -Search and Median
  -Rotate Image
  -Spiral Matrix


✅LinkedList:
  -Creation
  -Insertion(Start, end, Kth position)
  -Deletion(Start, end, Kth position)
  -Traverse
  -Reverse
  -Detect cycle
  -Circular and Doubly

✅Stack:
  -LIFO
  -Push, Pop, Peek
  -Implement using Arrays, LL, 2 Queues.


✅Queue:
  -FIFO
  -Push, Pop, Peek
  -Implement using Arrays, LL, 2 Stacks.


✅Trees:
  -Tree types
  -DFS: Uses Stack 
      In recursion:
      -Preorder  :Node->Left->Right
      -Inorder   :Left->Node->Right
      -Postorder :Left->Right->Node
      
  -BFS: Uses Queue
      -Levelorder


✅Graphs:
  -Directed
  -Undirected
