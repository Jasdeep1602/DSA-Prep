     ->Identity Matrix: An identity matrix is a special diagonal matrix where all diagonal elements are 1, and all non-diagonal elements are 0.
     ->Symmetric Matrix: A symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its transpose.The entries of a symmetric matrix are symmetric with respect
       to the main diagonal. Note: The transpose of a matrix is found by interchanging its rows into columns or columns into rows.
     ->Sparse Matrix: A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. Sparse matrices are often used in situations where storage space
       needs to be optimized.
